Introduction
The Simple Quiz App is a basic web-based application designed to present users with a series of multiple-choice questions and display their score at the end. This project is an excellent starting point for beginners who want to learn about web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##	Objectives

##	Technologies Used
-	**HTML:** The HyperText Markup Language is used to structure the content of the web application. It defines the elements such as headings, paragraphs, buttons, and links.
-	**CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are used to style the HTML elements and layout. CSS is responsible for the visual presentation, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
-	**JavaScript:** A programming language used to implement the interactive elements of the application. JavaScript handles the quiz logic, processes user input, and updates the content dynamically.
