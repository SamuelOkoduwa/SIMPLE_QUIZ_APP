#	Simple Quiz App
Introduction
The Simple Quiz App is a basic web-based application designed to present users with a series of multiple-choice questions and display their score at the end. This project is an excellent starting point for beginners who want to learn about web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##	Objectives
-	To create a simple and interactive quiz application.
-	To practice using HTML for structuring web content.
-	To use CSS for styling the application and improving its visual appeal.
-	To implement JavaScript for handling the quiz logic and user interactions.

##	Technologies Used
-	**HTML:** The HyperText Markup Language is used to structure the content of the web application. It defines the elements such as headings, paragraphs, buttons, and links.
-	**CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are used to style the HTML elements and layout. CSS is responsible for the visual presentation, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
-	**JavaScript:** A programming language used to implement the interactive elements of the application. JavaScript handles the quiz logic, processes user input, and updates the content dynamically.

**index.html:** The home page route that links the quiz app
**quiz.html:** The main HTML file that contains the structure of the quiz app.
**styles.css:** The CSS file that contains the styling rules for the quiz app.
**quiz.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the quiz app.
